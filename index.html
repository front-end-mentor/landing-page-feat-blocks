			<h2>Grow Together</h2>
			<p>
				Generate meaningful discussions with your audience and build a strong,
				loyal community. Think of the insightful conversations you miss out on
				with a feedback form.

			<h2>Flowing Conversations</h2>
			<p>
				You wouldn't paginate a conversation in real life, so why do it online?
				Our threads have just-in-time loading for a more natural flow.
			</p>
			<h2>Your Users</h2>
			<p>
				It takes no time at all to integrate Huddle with your app's
				authentication solution. This means, once signed in to your app, your
				users can start chatting immediately.
